# Feishin Bridge
[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/br0k3x/feishin-bridge/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/br0k3x/feishin-bridge/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
This project has been discontinued after I found out Rainmeter could do WebSockets. 💔  
You may use this for projects that can't use WebSockets though, this has most or all of the data.  
An API that communicates with Feishin's Remote server (togglable in Settings > Advanced)  
The username and password of the remote server should be blank.  
Icon from iiPythonx's Feishin fork ([check it out, it's really good!](https://github.com/iiPythonx/feishin))

A Rainmeter skin is provided to display the current song!
